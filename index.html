    <p>
        A full stack developer is a person who is comfortable working in the front-end and back-end <br>
        side of web development. It does not mean you have mastered everything about web development; <br>
        it means that you can work on both the front-end and back-end, with minimal assistance. <br>
        It’s no wonder that employers look for full stack developers. Finding a job in the tech <br>
        industry can be easy if you have the skill requirement. The more skill you have, the more valuable you become.
        <br>
        To master the concepts of full stack development, you need to understand its technical foundations <br>
        and complex frameworks. Spending more time to explore different programming languages can hone <br>
        your skills, speed up your learning progress and solidify your reputation. We cannot conclude <br>
        that if you spend ten years of your life studying full stack development, you’ll become a proficient <br>
        full stack developer afterward. In reality, you can achieve the status if you absorb all you’ve learned, <br>
        apply them impeccably and create your mark in the web industry through excellent works and contributions. <br>
        Remember, time, focus, willingness to learn and perseverance matters.
